### Configuration basics

Embark will check your preferred storage configuration in the file ``config/storage.js``. This file will contain the preferred configuration for each environment, with ``default`` being the configuration that applies to every environment. Each of those fields can be individually overridden on a per environment basis.

e.g.:

<pre><code class="javascript"> module.exports = {
  "default": {
    "enabled": true,
    "ipfs_bin": "ipfs",
    "available_providers": ["ipfs", "swarm"],
    "upload":{
      "provider": "ipfs",
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 5001,
      "getUrl": "http://localhost:8080/ipfs"
    },
    "dappConnection":[
      {"provider": "swarm", "host": "localhost", "port": 8500, "getUrl": "http://localhost:8500/bzz:/"},
      {"provider": "ipfs", "host": "localhost", "port": 5001, "getUrl": "http://localhost:8080/ipfs/"}
    ],
    "versions": {
      "ipfs-api": "17.2.4"
    }
  },
  "development": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "ipfs",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5001
  }
}
</code></pre>

Available options are:

Option | Type: `default` | Value         
--- | --- | --- 
`enabled`    | boolean: `true` | Enables or completely disables storage support
`ipfs_bin`    | string: `ipfs` | Name or desired path to the ipfs binary
`available_providers`    | array: `["ipfs", "swarm"]` | List of storages to be supported on the dapp. This will affect what's available with the EmbarkJS library on the dapp.
`upload`      | | The upload element specifies storage provider settings used for uploading your dapp. A swarm node will be automatically launched in a child process using these settings.
`upload.provider`    | string: `ipfs` | Desired provider to use when uploading dapp.
`upload.protocol`    | string: `http` | Storage provider protocol for upload, ie `http` or `https`
`upload.host`        | string: `localhost` | Host value used to interact with the storage provider for upload, i.e. `localhost` or `swarm-gateways.net`
`upload.port`        | integer: `5001` | Port value used to interact with the storage provider for upload, i.e. `5001` (IPFS local node) or `8500` (Swarm local node) or `80`
`upload.getUrl`      | string: `http://localhost:8080/ipfs/` | Only for IPFS. This sets the file/document retrieval URL, which is different than the host/port combination used to interact with the IPFS API.
`dappConnection`     | | List of storage providers to attempt connection to in the dapp. Each provider process will be launched in a child process. Each connection listed will be tried in order on the dapp, until one is avaialable. Can also specify `$BZZ` to attempt to connect to an injected swarm object.
`dappConnection.provider` | string: `ipfs` | Desired provider to use for dapp storage. 
`dappConnection.protocol`    | string: `http` | Storage provider protocol used in the dapp, i.e. `http` or `https`
`dappConnection.host`        | string | Host value used to interact with the storage provider in the dapp, i.e. `localhost` or `swarm-gateways.net`
`dappConnection.port`        | integer | Port value used to interact with the storage provider in the dapp, i.e. `5001` (IPFS local node) or `8500` (Swarm local node) or `80`. Can specify `false` if a port should not be included in the connection URL (i.e. for a public gateway like `http://swarm-gateways.net`).
`dappConnection.getUrl`      | string | Only for IPFS. This sets the file/document retrieval URL, which is different than the host/port combination used to interact with the IPFS API.
`versions`    | object | key-value hash of library and its desired version

### Using a local node

Either for IPFS or Swarm, Embark will default to use a local node for development purposes

Please note that you still need to set up the right port according to the storage platform you use.

By default, IPFS runs on port `5001` and Swarm runs on `8500`.

You can start your local storage node yourself or now you can also let Embark start the node itself in another node.

Letting Embark do it for you lets you focus on developing faster while starting it yourself gives you more flexibility.

You still need to have IPFS or Swarm installed locally for it to work, whatever the case.

**Important configurations for swarm**:

<pre><code class="json">{
  "development": {
    "provider": "swarm",
    "account": {
      "address": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS",
      "password": "PATH/TO/PASSWORD/FILE"
    },
    "swarmPath": "PATH/TO/SWARM/EXECUTABLE"
  }
}
</code></pre>

### Using a public gateway

To use a public gateway (instead of running a local node) for IPFS or Swarm, use the following `config/storage.js` options:
#### IPFS
<pre><code class="json">"development": {
  "enabled": true,
  "upload":{
    "provider": "ipfs",
    "host": "ipfs.infura.io",
    "port": 80,
    "protocol": "https",
    "getUrl": "https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/"
  }
}
</code></pre>

#### Swarm
<pre><code class="json">"development": {
  "enabled": true,
  "upload": {
    "provider": "swarm",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8500
  }
}
</code></pre>

### Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>

If you are running your own processes for IPFS or Swarm, the CORS needs to be set to the domain of your DApp, to the geth domain, and to the domain of the storage used inside the DApp. If you are using the built in webserver, the CORS would need to be set to `http://localhost:8000`, however if you are using `embark upload`, the domain of the decentralised storage host should be included in CORS. Depending on your `upload` settings in `storage.js`, this could be `http://localhost:8080` or `http://ipfs.infura.io` for IPFS or it could be `http://localhost:8500` or `http://swarm-gateways.net` for Swarm. Of course, if you are hosting your DApp on a different domain (i.e. not `localhost`, then that would need to be included in CORS as well. Examples of how to include multiple domains for each are below:

```
# Configure local IPFS node that has the local swarm node whitelisted for CORS
# Works in the case where IPFS hosts the DApp, but you are running your storage inside the DApp on Swarm (or IPFS, since it doesn't need to whitelist itself)
ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin "[\"http://localhost:8000\", \"http://localhost:8500\", \"http://localhost:8545\", \"ws://localhost:8546\"]"
```
NOTE: `http://localhost:8545` and `ws://localhost:8546` are for geth.

```
# Run local Swarm node that has the local IPFS node whitelisted for CORS
# Works in the case where Swarm hosts the DApp, but you are running your storage inside the DApp on IPFS (or Swarm, since it doesn't need to whitelist itself)
swarm --bzzaccount=fedda09fd9218d1ea4fd41ad44694fa4ccba1878 --datadir=~/.bzz-data/ --password=config/development/password --corsdomain=http://localhost:8000,http://localhost:8080,http://localhost:8545,ws://localhost:8546 --ens-api=''
```
